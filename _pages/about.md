I am currently a Theoretical and Computational Neuroscience PhD Student at FAU. I am working with the [Machine Perception and Cognitive Robotics Laboratory](mpcrlab.com) as well as the [Center for Future Mind](https://www.fau.edu/future-mind/). My primary research goal is to build nonlinear models of artificial intelligence(AI). I am also working with [NDEWS](https://ndews.org/novel-surveillance/web-surveillance/) to try to use AI to predict substance abuse and increase harm reduction. In my spare time I like to educate people about AI, think about cybernetics as a mechanism to help knowledge workers, and explore natural philosophy (using the scientific method to find answer's to life's Big Questions.
