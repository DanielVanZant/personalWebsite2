I am a Theoretical and Computational Neuroscience PhD Student at Florida Atlantic University. I am affiliated with the [Machine Perception and Cognitive Robotics Laboratory](mpcrlab.com) and the [Center for Future Mind](https://www.fau.edu/future-mind/). I build bio-inspired nonlinear models of artificial intelligence. 
I am working with [NDEWS](https://ndews.org/novel-surveillance/web-surveillance/) to use machine-learning methods to predict nationwide substance abuse patterns. 
In my spare time, I educate people about AI, think about cybernetics as a mechanism to help knowledge workers, and explore natural philosophy.
All opinions are my own.
