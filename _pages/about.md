I am a Theoretical and Computational Neuroscience PhD Student at Florida Atlantic University. I am affiliated with the [Machine Perception and Cognitive Robotics Laboratory](mpcrlab.com) as well as the [Center for Future Mind](https://www.fau.edu/future-mind/). I'm interested in buliding better nonlinear models of artificial general intelligence. 
I am also working with [NDEWS](https://ndews.org/novel-surveillance/web-surveillance/) to use machine-learning methods to predict nationwide substance abuse patterns. 
In my spare time I like to educate people about AI, think about cybernetics as a mechanism to help knowledge workers, and explore natural philosophy (using the scientific method to find answer's to life's Big Questions.
All opinions are my own.
